Every year I decide I should write more. I then look at my current blog, look
away in disgust, and set out to build the entire thing from the ground up. I
went from [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "wordpress") (extremely well
documented) to [Ghost](https://ghost.org "ghost") (moderately well documented at
the time) to - now - [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org "gatsby") (don't even get me
started). The only reasonable explanation for this maniacal journey is that I
have multiple people living inside my head with one common trait - the
insatiable desire to see the world burn.

In lieu of trying something new (and hoping it sticks), I've decided to add some
constraints:

* An overarching theme of *Excerpts from my org files* - i.e. notes to
  myself, things I want to read/watch/hear/learn, rants on things I
  read/watch/hear/learn, and reflections on Emacs.
* Hand-in-hand enhancements & writing. Every enhancment **will** have a post but
  not every post will have an enhancement, to ensure I don't hamstring my
  oh-so-creative side with silly features.
